### How do I get set up? ###

# SMC and NVRAM need to be reset.
# NVRAM rest:
# Shut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately hold down these four keys together: 
# Option, Command, P, and R. Keep holding the keys for about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart (the screen will flash).
# When it starts up again, you will notice that the screen has max brightness 
# (If you have a Mac that plays a startup sound when you turn it on, you can release the keys after the second startup sound.)
#
# SMC reset:
# 1. Shut down your Mac.
# 2. Unplug the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter from your computer.
# 3. Using the built-in keyboard, press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the keyboard, then press the power button at the same time. 
#    Hold these keys and the power button for 10 seconds.
#    If you have a 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch ID, the Touch ID button is also the power button.
# 4. Release all keys. You don't really know if anything happened.
# 5. Reconnect the power adapter.
# 6. Press the power button again to turn on your Mac.
